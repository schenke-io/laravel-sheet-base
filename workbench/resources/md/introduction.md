The **Laravel Sheet Base** package simplifies data processing by offering a collection of classes specifically tailored for building efficient data conversion pipelines. These pipelines are well-suited for scenarios where data modifications occur infrequently.

Here are some ideal use cases for this package:

* **Manually edited data sources:** When most of your data originates from manual edits by specialists.
* **Infrequent data changes:** When your data remains relatively stable over time.
* **Command line efficiency:** When utilizing a developer console command proves more efficient than a web form for data processing tasks.

These pipelines involve **reading data** from **endpoints**
on one end and **processing & storing** it using a **writer**
on the other. Each pipeline uses a **schema** to define
the **table format** for the writer.

The Laravel Sheet Base package simplifies managing and
transforming data in your Laravel applications.
It offers several useful features:

- **Work with various data formats:** Import data from
  CSV files and export it to JSON, YAML, or Neon formats.
- **Extract translations:** Easily gather translations
  from different sources and generate language files.
- **Combine data sources:** Merge data from multiple
  sources into a single, targeted output.
- **Transform and write data:** Read data, perform
  calculations, and write the resulting transformed data.
- **Generate files:** Create files for seeding, backups,
  configuration, or Laravel Sushi integration.

The package utilizes a flexible and extensible pipeline
architecture, making data management tasks efficient and straightforward.
